A remote Predator license plate list management and distribution utility.


## Description

The Predator ALPR system supports "hot lists", which are lists of license plates that are of interest, and should be alerted to. This utility is designed to be a simple remote hot-list management system, and allows administrators to add, remove, and view entries in the hot list. This tool can also serve hot lists to clients.
